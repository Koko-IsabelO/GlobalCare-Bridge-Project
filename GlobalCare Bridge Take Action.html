        In 2023, the Universal Health Coverage reported that providing quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare stagnated. It is possible to limit this disparity in healthcare. One way is to reduce the gender gap in healthcare. According to World Economic Forum, Women are under-represented in medical research, and because of this, women are left in poor health for longer, but with more funded research, how long women are left in poor health can be reduced by 2/3. This increases the likelihood of women to have access to healthcare globally. Additionally, with the help of AI and machine learning, data can be analyzed to make precise diagnoses and detect disease on a global scale as organizations come together to tackle global issues. Also, many families in poverty are left without healthcare, and the cost of healthcare continues to rise, according to World Economic Forum. Poverty leads to inadequate nutrition, which results in poor health and heightened susceptibility to diseases. However, the New Frontiers of Nutrition are working to make nutritious foods accessible globally. This is just a fraction of what can be done to ensure that everyone, regardless of race, gender, sex, or religion are given equal healthcare.

     >Poor diets are estimated to cause <b>11 million deaths,</b> accounting for 20% of total deaths.  (WEF,2024).
     <br><br>
     >In Past two decades, <b>less than</b> a third of countries have improved health service coverage and reduced catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending.  (WHO)

     <br><br>

     >As of 2021,  the richest 20% of households accounted for over half of the aggregate household income and had an income of $149,132 or higher compared to the bottom 20% of households who accounted for <b>less than 3% </b>bof the aggregate household income and had incomes of $28,007 or less (KFF, 2023 ).
